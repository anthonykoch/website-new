Ryan Florence recently asked a simple question on X recently. Why is the mobile web not animated in the fashion that Emil Kowalski shows?

There's many potential reasons for this. I think the first and most obvious are that:

Animations in general are incredibly hard to do **well** if you don't know what you're doing. I mean, a ton of us literally just bought a $300.00 course just to learn how to make cool animations as shown by Emil. 


Well, because it's difficult. Take it from me, a frontend engineer who has worked on Opal Camera, which is extremely heavy on animation. 

The web is accessible.

Animations like these are uncommon.  may be jarring to users
